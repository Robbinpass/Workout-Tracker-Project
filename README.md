You use this app by using Postman requests

Run npm i, enter the mysql2 and source db/schema.sql; -then exit,run node seeds for the base Data then do node server.js for the site to open. Once the site is open click on the top right of the screen where it says "login or signup". It will take you the a screen to have you sign up and it will save you password and username. If you already have an account you can log in and it will check to see if the password and username is correct.
